<h3>Messaging Action Items</h3>

<ol>
  <li><strong>State and USAID encourage Missions to promote official deliveries of COVID-19 vaccines AFTER announced by Gavi, if appropriate for the country or regional context.</strong></li>
  <li>Please make sure Gavi has made a public announcement before you promote in-country.</li>
  <li><strong>If you become aware of a pending delivery</strong> through the COVAX Advance Market Commitment, please inform <a>covidcomms@usaid.gov</a>, <a>MCMCoordinationGroup@state.gov</a>, and <a>CGRCUInternal@state.gov</a> for awareness. We recognize that deliveries may occur on short notice for various reasons.  Local UNICEF officials may have more information on timing of deliveries. (Note: Post should <strong>not</strong> contact UNICEF related to deliveries for self-financing participants.  U.S. investments in COVAX only support procurement and distribution to 92 low- and middle- income economies receiving doses via the COVAX Advanced Market Commitments (AMC)).</li>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>For posts with countries receiving doses via the COVAX AMCs</strong>, it is recommended for posts to coordinate with the appropriate UN official or through USAID to the Ministry of Health on timing for vaccine deliveries. (<strong>NOTE:</strong> Posts should NOT brand the packaging with USAID or USG branding or logos)</li>
    </ol>
  <li><strong>For country-level announcements:</strong> Only after Gavi has officially announced a vaccine allocation or delivery, Post can re-share or promote the announcement using the resources below, including social media content, talking points and building blocks for op-eds, and USAID’s frequently asked questions.</li>
  <li><strong>For country-level events:</strong> If an Ambassador or Mission Director is asked to participate in an announcement, such as an event or video, please send the planned remarks to <a>covidcomms@usaid.gov</a>, <a>MCMCoordinationGroup@state.gov</a>, and <a>CGRCUInternal@state.gov</a> for awareness.</li>
  <li><strong>For the latest public information on vaccine deliveries</strong>, you can track <strong>live updates</strong> on <strong><a>Gavi’s website</a></strong>. Gavi has also published the <strong>first round of country allocations <a>here</a></strong>.</li>
